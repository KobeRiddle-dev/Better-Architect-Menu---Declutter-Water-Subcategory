# Better Architect Menu | Declutter Water Subcategory

Declutter your water category!.

Moves:

- Animal Water Trough, Pet Water Bowl, and Litter Box to Animals/Ranching
- Bathroom fixtures and Kitchen Sink to a new Furniture subcategory called "Hygiene"
- Fire Sprinkler to Area/Firefoam (now renamed to "Fire Suppression").
- Radiators to Area/Heating
- Washing Machine to Production/Processing

This leaves Resources/Water with just water infrastructure, and the users of water are all in more sensible places. After all, you don't have the Electric Smelter in the Power category just because it uses electricity.
